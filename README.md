# Arch Setup Install

This setup was intended for the Arch Linux distro.

This project was developed in order to assist in the installation of the tools 
that I use most in my work environment. Being them:

- Visual Studio Code (and your extensions);
- Discord;
- Spotify;
- Yay (Arch Linux);
- Editor Config;
- ZSH (and Oh My ZSH!);
- Git;
- Docker;
- Google Chrome;

**If you wish, feel free to use this setup the way you want!**
